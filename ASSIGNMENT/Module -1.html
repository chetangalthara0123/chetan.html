      4.Accessibility: SVG supports accessibility features, making it possible to create graphics that are friendly to users with disabilities. This is particularly important for web design and other applications where accessibility is a priority.
      
     5. Text-Based: Being text-based, SVG files can be compressed, making them smaller in file size. This can lead to faster loading times for web pages and reduced bandwidth usage.
